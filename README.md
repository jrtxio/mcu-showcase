# MCU Showcase

A collection of example projects for microcontroller (MCU) development.  
This repository is organized into four categories:

1. **driver** — Hardware drivers, such as GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC/DAC.
2. **app** — Application layer examples, using drivers or RTOS features.
3. **rtos** — RTOS examples, including task scheduling, queues, semaphores, and timers.
4. **bootloader** — Bootloader and firmware upgrade examples, including serial/USB/OTA update demos.

> ⚠️ Note: All projects are for learning, reference, and quick prototyping purposes.
